## Introduction

NumPy (Numerical Python) is an essential library for numerical computations in Python. It offers support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

## Installation

To install NumPy, use the following pip command:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
